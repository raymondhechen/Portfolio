                <T3>The Whole Foods problem</T3>
                <Section>
                    Ever since this pandemic started, my parents have been keen to stay away from the public at all costs, erecting a barrier between the world and our home. 
                    This meant getting takeout delivered (which had to be reheated), letting mail sit for days, and picking up groceries curbside.
                    On one particular day, I caught a glimpse of the huge endeavor that Amazon has embarked on with Whole Foods delivery and pickup. 
                    For those who don't know, Whole Foods (which Amazon owns) has created a service to allow customers to sit in designated parking spots and wait for a employee to deliver groceries to the customers' cars.
                    However, on this day, the dispatchers were horrendously late, and no quality explanation was given except that the dispatchers were exceptionally busy.

                    They did hint though that the store itself didn't actually handle any requests individually.
                    Rather, Amazon internally handles all requests (through the Amazon app/website), and notifies the store, which the dispatcher then sends an employee to fulfill the request.
                    I could be very wrong about this, but this makes sense from a management standpoint.
                    Although it would probably be cleaner and more scalable for stores to handle requests on their own, having a centralized internal service promises Amazon and their engineers greater control and flexibility.

                    Ok that aside, this got me curious about what the allocation algorithms looked like. 
                    More specifically, I supposed the simplist routine was that a dispatcher hands a deliverer the list of items that a customer has ordered.
                    The employee (which we'll call a <Bold>deliverer</Bold> from now on) would then roam the aisles picking everything up, before bagging it and finally handing off the baton to the customer.
                    But is any more optimization performed? Are deliverers sent on a specific route through the store to optimize routing times? 
                    Are deliverers dispatched a specific set of orders too that could double up on similar items? 
                    It's extremely unlikely since most store layouts differ in one way or another.
                    Regardless, here I'll at least attempt to devise such an algorithm for a rather generic store.

                    We'll consider two specific problems.
                    <List>
                        <Bold>1. How can we allocate orders to deliverers efficiently?</Bold><br/>
                        <Bold>2. How can we route deliverers thorugh stores efficiently</Bold>
                    </List>
                </Section>
                <T3>Order allocation</T3>
                <Section>
                    Let's tackle the first problem. We'll assume the following setup and considerations.
                    <List>
                        1. All orders must be fulfilled.<br/>
                        2. There are <code>n</code> deliverers.<br/>
                        3. Customer orders cannot be split between deliverers.<br/>
                        4. Time cost between switching to another item is a constant unit, and quantity per item do not matter.<br/>
                    </List>
                    This should simplify this problem a ton.
                </Section>
                <Section>
                    Let's consider an example and assume optimization is determined by the summation of time cost for all deliverers.
                    We have 2 deliverers, but 3 orders, in the form <code>{'{ Item: Quantity }'}</code>.
                    How do we allocate orders efficiently with the conditons above?
                    <List>
                        <span style={{color: 'green'}}>1.</span> <code>{'{'} A: 5, B: 2, C: 3{'}'} </code><br/>
                        <span style={{color: 'blue'}}>2.</span> <code>{'{'} A: 5, B: 10, D: 8{'}'} </code><br/>
                        <span style={{color: 'red'}}>3.</span> <code>{'{'} D: 5, E: 5{'}'} </code>
                    </List>
                    We'll consider two cases.
                    Assume deliverer 1 picks up orders <span style={{color: 'green'}}>1</span> and <span style={{color: 'blue'}}>2</span>. 
                    Then deliverer 1 has time cost of 4 (<code>A -> B -> C -> D</code>).
                    Deliverer 2 has a time cost of 2 for order <span style={{color: 'red'}}>3</span> (<code>D -> E</code>), summing to a total time cost of 6.
                    What if deliverer 1 had taken orders <span style={{color: 'blue'}}>2</span> and <span style={{color: 'red'}}>3</span> instead, leaving order <span style={{color: 'green'}}>1</span> to deliverer 2?
                    Then deliverer 1 would have a time cost of 4 (<code>A -> B -> D -> E</code>), while deliverer 3 would have a cost of 2 (<code>A -> B -> C</code>).
                    This totals 7 units, so we can clearly see that proper allocations do indeed optimize time spent.
                </Section>
                <Section>
                    However, note that if one deliverer actually picked up all orders, then the time cost would also be minimized. 
                    Thus, we surmised our optimization condition incorrectly, missing that deliverers are acting concurrently.
                    So let's change this problem's goal a bit. We'll instead determine optimization by the time it takes for the final deliverer to finish his or her orders, where all deliverers are acting asynchronously.
                    In the above example then, with deliverer 1 picking up orders <span style={{color: 'green'}}>1</span> and <span style={{color: 'blue'}}>2</span>, the optimal time cost would instead be 4.
                </Section>
                <Section>
                    Let's generalize this now. 
                    Assume there are <code>n</code> orders and <code>m</code> deliverers such that <code>m {'â‰¤'} n</code>. 
                    Each order could have any number of items, so we'll designate each order's number of unique items as <code>n<sub>i</sub></code> where <code>i</code> is the order number.
                    The time cost per deliverer is <code>m<sub>j</sub></code> where <code>j</code> is the deliverer number.
                    We note that <code>m<sub>j</sub></code> will be the number of unique items among all of his or her orders.
                    So the way to optimize this problem then is to properly collect orders with a large amount of overlapping items for each deliverer, such that the largest collection's number of items is minimized.
