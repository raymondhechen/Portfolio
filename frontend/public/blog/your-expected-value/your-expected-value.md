# Your EV

For the stats folks out there, a concept you’ll frequently hear about is expected value, aka EV. It is the mean, the average, of a set of outcomes. Typically it’s applied to some math problem, such as “what’s the EV of a bet on a Duke vs. UNC basketball game?”. However, another way to frame this is within the narrative of life paths. In my philosophy, we have a baseline life we could live if we did everything as average as possible. For example, I would probably get mediocre grades, been at a state school, worked more mediocre gigs.

But perhaps in this EV line, I could have been happier without the weight of career pressures on my mental health. So I think a better way to frame this is within a space of attributes that I index success heavily on. To me, that’s three things: relationships, career, and happiness.

Each path or decision I take has tradeoffs. I could take a higher paying job in a subpar location which deteriorates my relationships. Or I could spend a majority of my time fooling around with friends, which would cost my job. As abstract or nonsensical it is, there’s an EV life path somewhere within this matrix. For some reason, many of us including myself have made it a life goal to break out of that EV. The universe doesn’t demand it nor does it manifest itself into existence. But we all have that will in us to some degree or another.

As a result, my greatest fear for most of my life was living one of mediocracy. In high school, I was daunted by the notion of being a failure. I was terrified by finding myself at my EV or worse. So I spent my high school days working on bullshit problem sets and research projects with the sole goal of achieving a single character on paper: an A. Sometimes, I tell jokingly to myself, “all of that, and for what?” I think it’s clear what it was all for though: to get into college.
